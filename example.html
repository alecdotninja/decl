      John of Worcester

      <p>
        John of Worcester (died c. 1140) was an English monk and chronicler who worked at Worcester Priory. He is usually held to
        be the author of the Chronicon ex chronicis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greater part of the work, up to 1117 or 1118, was formerly attributed to the man Florence of Worcester on the basis of
        the entry for his death under the annal of 1118, which credits his skill and industry for making the chronicle such
        a prominent work. In this view, the other Worcester monk, John, merely wrote the final part of the work. However,
        there are two main objections against the ascription to Florence. First, there is no change of style in the Chronicon
        after Florence's death, and second, certain sections before 1118 rely to some extent on the Historia novorum of Eadmer
        of Canterbury, which was completed sometime in 1121 - 1124.

      Greek Army uniforms
    </div>
    <div class="expandable-row-context">
      <p>
        The modern Greek Army has a history of over 180 years, during which has undergone dramatic changes and been involved in some
        of the major conflicts on the European continent. The modern Greek military throughout its history was closely following
        international developments in equipment and uniforms. With the notable exception of the elite Evzones units, which
        based their uniforms on the indigenous traditional garments of the 18th century, the rest of the Army, as most militaries
        worldwide, was always quick to adopt the military fashion current among the armies of the influential Great Powers.
        This influence can be roughly divided in three periods: French-style uniforms, which dominated throughout the 19th
        century (with many Bavarian elements during the reign of King Otto, and some Austrian and Russian influences later
        on), the British styles introduced around World War I and used during World War II and until the late 1960s, and
        the "NATO" or US-style predominating from ca. 1968 onward. Various individual items or details can of course be traced
        to other influences, and there were also transitional uniforms combining previous designs.
